# Git Reference (WIP)
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that is used to track changes in code. It is a popular choice for software development teams because it allows them to collaborate on code changes and easily revert to previous versions of the code. Git is also a powerful tool for managing personal projects.

Key features of Git:

* **Distributed:** Git is a distributed system, which means that every developer has a complete copy of the code. This makes it easy for developers to work on the same project without having to constantly sync with each other.
* **Version control:** Git tracks changes to the code so that you can easily revert to previous versions. This is helpful for debugging problems or recovering from mistakes.
* **Collaboration:** Git makes it easy to collaborate on code changes. Developers can create branches to work on new features, and then merge those branches back into the main branch when they are ready.
* **Merging:** Git provides a variety of merging strategies to help you combine changes from different branches. This can be helpful when resolving conflicts between different versions of the code.
* **Hosting:** There are many hosting services available for Git repositories. This makes it easy to share your code with others and collaborate on projects remotely.
